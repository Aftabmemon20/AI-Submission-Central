AI Submission Central (A.S.C.)The Future of Hackathon Judging is Here.A.S.C. is an AI-powered, multi-tenant platform designed to automate the initial screening and evaluation of hackathon projects. It uses a sophisticated agent-based architecture, powered by Docker and Cerebras AI, to provide unbiased, data-driven insights, saving judges hundreds of hours and reducing human bias.üé• Project Demo(This section is a placeholder for a screen recording or GIF of your application in action. This is optional, but highly recommended for making a strong impression.)[Paste a GIF of your application here]The ProblemHackathon judging is broken. It's slow, tiring, inconsistent, and doesn't scale. Judges are forced to spend hours on repetitive screening tasks instead of focusing on what truly matters: a project's innovation and impact.Our Solution: An Autonomous Judging AgentA.S.C. solves this by providing a complete platform for judges and submitters.How It Works (The User Journey)The Judge Creates a Session: A judge logs in, creates a new "hackathon session," and sets their specific judging criteria in plain English (e.g., "The project must use Python").The Judge Shares an ID: The system generates a unique Hack ID for that session, which the judge shares with the students.The Student Submits: A student logs in and enters the Hack ID to join the session. They then fill out the submission form with their project details.The AI Evaluates: In the background, our autonomous agent analyzes the project's GitHub repo and YouTube demo against the judge's live criteria using the Cerebras AI.The Judge Gets the Results: The evaluated project instantly appears on the judge's private dashboard for that hackathon, automatically sorted into "AI Accepted" or "AI Rejected" categories with detailed justifications.Tech Stack & ArchitectureFrontend: Next.js, TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Aceternity UI, Clerk (for Authentication)Backend: Python, Flask, Docker, GunicornAI & Inference: Cerebras Cloud APIDatabase: SQLAlchemy with SQLiteüèÜ A Creative Implementation of the Docker MCP GatewayOur architecture is a creative, real-world implementation of the Docker MCP Gateway philosophy. The central agent service acts as the Controller, orchestrating containerized Tools (github-reader, video-parser) and making an Inference call to the Cerebras AI, all based on the judge's initial Instruction.üöÄ Local Setup InstructionsPrerequisitesDocker & Docker ComposeNode.js & npmA Cerebras Cloud API KeyA Clerk.dev account with API keys1. Clone the RepositoryIMPORTANT: In the line below, replace <...> with your actual GitHub repository URL.git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
2. Configure Backend EnvironmentCreate a .env file in the project root and add your Cerebras API key:# .env
CEREBRAS_API_KEY="your_cerebras_api_key_here"
3. Configure Frontend EnvironmentNavigate to the frontend folder. Create a new file named .env.local and add your Clerk keys:# frontend/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...your_publishable_key...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...your_secret_key...
CRITICAL: You also need to configure the Judge's email in frontend/src/app/page.tsx to gain access to the Judge's Portal.4. Build and Run the BackendWith Docker running, execute the following from the project root:docker-compose up --build
5. Run the FrontendOpen a new terminal, navigate to the frontend folder, and run:# In the /frontend directory
npm install
npm run dev
Your application is now running at http://localhost:3000.
